To access the consumer dataset, we have provided a link below:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database/resource/484bc506-82b0-4225-ab10-496cf7a1c2e9

Through this link, there will be a heading with the Comma Seperated Values File. Click on that download file and put
it in the location of desktop to be able to run our code properly.
Unfortunately, the file is too big to upload to github, so we have to work with it locally.
