To access the consumer dataset, we have provided a link below:
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database/resource/484bc506-82b0-4225-ab10-496cf7a1c2e9

Through this link, there will be a heading with the Comma Seperated Values File. Click on that download file, clone the repo,
and add the excel file to the cloned repo to be able to run the code we have provided.
Unfortunately, the file is too big to upload to github, so we have to work with it locally.
